Predicting the stock market is a topic of great intrest to many people.  News and consumer sentiment play a crucial role in influencing stock prices, as traders continuously monitor financial news and social media to assess supply, demand, and market trends. This process requires constant tracking, interpretation, and decision-making to respond effectively to market fluctuations. It is therefore evident that an NLP system could be of great use, being able to (1) summarise articles and identify key information and (2) provide sentiment variables as input features for a stock price prediction model.
