         "Hot Topics",

         "This week’s Federal Budget should be the economic centrepiece for this year but instead it is looking like something of an accident. The reason, of course, is that this is the Budget that was never planned to happen. In its place there should be an election campaign in full swing but due to the Queensland cyclone Alfred, the election was postponed and the Budget was suddenly back out of hibernation. So what should we expect to see in this accidental budget? Hopefully and perhaps surprisingly, we may not get a large raft of election promises given the hints that Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been giving about the budget position and also the economic circumstances happening due to the burgeoning trade war being waged by President Trump. Challenging outlook tempers new promises In Dr Chalmers own words the economic outlook is looking very challenging and uncertain and Australia will be far from immune from the continuing raft of tariffs that are adding significant clouds to the trade outlook. With two budget surpluses in the bank and the current financial year also looking like surprising with a much smaller deficit, we might have expected some more big, shiny promises and possibly even some much-needed tax reform. Instead, it looks like the Budget may be relatively austere given that much of the unexpected government revenue that has arrived over the past couple of years owes its existence to non-repeatable factors including the war in Ukraine, which unexpectedly boosted the value of mineral exports. Some big promises already made It is important to note as well that there have already been some expensive promises made including $8.5 billion for Medicare, $7.2 billion for the Bruce Highway upgrade and $3 billion to improve the National Broadband Network. All have been matched by Opposition Leader Peter Dutton so the Budget is likely to leave leeway for a series of smaller pre-election promises to be made but don’t expect too much. According to a Budget forecast prepared by Deloitte, the budget is expected to reveal an underlying cash deficit of $26.1 billion for the 2025 financial year, while forward revenues are expected to deteriorate by $11.3 billion over four years. If the Deloitte report is correct this deficit will mark an $800 million improvement over the projections contained in the 2024-25 mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (MYEFO). One last sugar hit of surprise revenue upgrades is set to boost the numbers but these extra taxes are expected to start drying up in the 2025-26 financial year, with Deloitte expecting deficits to worsen Taxes predicted to wane Indeed, in the four years to 2027-28, Deloitte expects a cumulative deterioration in the underlying cash balance of $13.1 billion compared to the latest official forecast – a major change from the underlying cash surplus of $15.8 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. Whether Deloitte’s projections are accurate or not, Treasurer Chalmers’ own caution in his remarks leading up to the Budget are enough to give us a hint so any direct cost of living support that’s handed out during the election will be relatively minor in the scheme of things. Surpluses came from one-off revenue gains “The magnitude of this turnaround illustrates the extent to which surpluses in recent years were the result of cyclical revenue gains rather than structural improvements in the budget,” said the Deloitte report. “Those surpluses still required fiscal discipline – surprise revenue upgrades were mostly saved rather than mostly spent. “But banking on revenue to surpass Treasury’s forecast does not make for a sound fiscal strategy,” said the report. As the report pointed out, Australia faces some large fiscal holes in the medium-term budget outlook and these holes are getting bigger rather than smaller with little visibility on either side of the political spectrum for means of closing these fiscal gaps. Anyway, the speculation will this week make way for the real thing with the release of the Budget on March 25. Just don’t expect too many expensive promises or many answers for Australia’s longer term Budget imbalances.",

         "It’s official – supermarket prices are rising too fast, or at least their share prices are. After a long-awaited report by the competition regulator which found the big supermarkets some of the most profitable retailers in the world, shareholders reacted by piling into Woolworths (ASX: WOW) and Coles (ASX: COL) shares. That set up the stage for the share market’s best weekly gain for the year with the ASX200 up 0.2% or 13.2 points to 7932.1 points on Friday. That took the weekly gain to 1.7%, the first such weekly rise for four weeks. The share market performance was a bit uneven with six of the 11 sectors higher led of course by consumer staples. Traders love profitable supermarkets Traders pushed Woolworths shares up 6.3% to $29.93 while Coles shares leapt 4.9% to $19.46 after the competition regulator fell short of accusing the supermarkets of price gouging. Shares in alcohol retailer Endeavour Group (ASX: EDV) also climbed by 2%. It was not all good news with mining stocks falling after US President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers to increase US production of critical minerals to decrease the country’s reliance on China. Trump fears on coal Traders believed that could also increase US coal production, with shares in local coal miner Yancoal (ASX: YAL) down 1.9% to $5.20 while shares in fellow coal producer Whitehaven (ASX: WHC) fell 2.8% to $5.72. It was a bit of a mixed day for the other miners with South32 (ASX: S32) shares falling 2.5% to $3.53 and Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) down 5.1% to $1.85. Spot iron ore futures in Singapore fell below US$100 a tonne, although shares in BHP (ASX: BHP) rose 1.1% and Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) shares were up 0.9% while Fortescue Metals (ASX: FMG) shares fell by 0.9%. Mixed day for banks It was also a mixed-up sort of day for the banks with Westpac (ASX: WBC) shares down before rallying near the end of the day to add 0.4% while shares in NAB (ASX: NAB) and ANZ (ASX: ANZ) were up by 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. Australia’s biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank (ASX: CBA), was out on its own with a 0.2% share price fall. The mood was gloomier for the healthcare and technology sectors, with shares in medical imaging software provider Pro Medicus (ASX: PME) down 6.5% to $223.58 and pharmaceutical giant Sigma Healthcare (ASX: SIG) shares off 1.4% to $2.87. Paladin down on mine closure Individual share prices also moved with company announcements with shares in Paladin Energy (ASX: PDN) down 4% to $6.56 after the miner was forced to close its Langer Heinrich Mine in Namibia after heavy rains interrupted access to the mine site. Emerald Resources (ASX: EMR) shares dropped 3.9% to $4 after quarterly output from its Okvau gold mine missed guidance. Solomon Lew’s Premier Investments (ASX: PMV) shares jumped by 3.9% to $21.85 after its subsidiary Peter Alexander’s sales hit a record $297.7 million in the first half. The retailer successfully downplayed its 12.8% fall in interim profit, saying a challenging consumer environment was to blame. Nine gets closer to backing Domain bid Nine Entertainment (ASX: NEC) shares rose by 0.6% after the media company confirmed it had begun negotiations about the sale of its stake in Domain to CoStar. That comes after the US property giant made a $2.7 billion bid for the asset last month, with the Nine board now set to consider the proposal. Innovative medical device disinfector Nanosonics (ASX: NAN) has been on an upward run which slowed a little after broker JPMorgan cut its recommendation from “neutral” to “underweight”. The stock still edged up 0.8% to $5.02, extending its 14% gain in the prior session. Small cap stock action The Small Ords Index rallied 2.39% for the week to close at 3076.4 points. ASX 200 vs Small Ords The week ahead Domestic news is set to take precedence in Australia this week as Treasurer Jim Chalmers releases the Federal Budget on Tuesday. Most economists expect that the underlying cash deficit for the coming year which was forecast to be $26.9 billion in December we will narrow a little to around $22.5 billion. As well as the budget, inflation numbers will be released with the CPI likely to be impacted by the unwinding of electricity rebates. Price rises for education fees are also expected to show a large lift, in part because of a very lagged CPI indexation. In America, the US Federal Reserve will also be closely watching its preferred personal consumption expenditures price index which is issued on Friday. The PCE is expected to be above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. It is also a really big week for dividend payouts for Australian shareholders with around $13.6 billion to be paid out to investors by 30 large companies. THIS WEEK’S TOP STOCKS",

         "Reports that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Indonesia are planning to collaborate on cobalt and nickel exports are threatening to have a substantial bearing on the global battery market. The DRC and Indonesia – the world’s top two cobalt suppliers – have discussed plans to reduce their cobalt exports. The two nations combined are responsible for more than 85% of total global cobalt production. Quotas already imposed DRC Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka announced that the country had already imposed quotas on cobalt production and stockpiles accumulated during a four-month export suspension initiated in February 2025. With no suspension of production, Fastmarkets expects DRC producers to stockpile cobalt while waiting for permission to export once again. The news has already affected the market for the critical mineral, with prices up by 84% since February 2025. ‘Significant impact’ “In the last four months of 2024, the DRC exported just under 68,000 tonnes of cobalt contained in hydroxide to China,” Fastmarkets analyst Robert Searle said. “A halt in these volumes will have a significant impact on the availability of feed for China’s refiners.” “When comparing China’s refined production in 2024 with total imported cobalt intermediate levels from the DRC and Indonesia, we can see there are still large inventories in the country–but should China continue to process metal at the rate it is, these will quickly be depleted should the export ban be upheld.” EV-driven demand Prior to the DRC move, Grand View Research valued the global cobalt market size at $26.96 billion in 2024 and predicted it to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.7% between 2025 and 2030. Grand View expects the rising production of electric vehicles (EVs) will increase cobalt consumption during this period. Lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide batteries, which have a cathode containing 10–20% cobalt, are the most common battery chemistries currently used in EVs. “The ban is likely to highlight Indonesia’s growing importance and critical role as a supplier of cobalt intermediates to China,” Mr Searle wrote.",

         "Solid state hydrogen storage developer GreenHy2 (ASX: H2G) has signed a contract with European technology supplier H2Core to provide leading-edge storage solution technologies. The H2Core deals are part of a wider series of new technology negotiations currently in progress. The agreements include new supercapacitor batteries and hydrogen technologies, which the company says have a number of significant advantages over previous technologies both in price and commercial readiness. Commercially competitive GreenHy2 managing director Dr Paul Dalgleish said that, by utilising graphene supercapacitors, the new battery solutions are now commercially competitive due to revolutionary low-cost manufacturing techniques. He said the significant reduction in cost for the graphene-based solution now provides the benefits of lithium-ion (Li-ion) and hydrogen combined. They also significantly outperform hybrid batteries, which are partially supercapacitor and partially Li-ion. Seasonal energy storage “Supercapacitor batteries and low-pressure hydrogen storage solutions both have their place […] and where supercapacitors will replace Li-ion solutions, hydrogen is still well-placed to provide seasonal energy storage shift due to its virtually nil self-discharge rate,” he said. “The limitation until now of providing large-scale supercapacitor batteries has been cost.” “However advances in manufacturing graphene have made it possible to provide the majority of storage in supercapacitors and take advantage of their considerable benefits over other technologies.” Exceptionally long life According to GreenHy2, the new storage technology provides exceptionally long life of 500,000 cycles at cell level and delivers between 25 to 40 years of life at three cycles per day, compared to six to 10 years for lithium-ion and 30 years for hydrogen. The company suggests it is extremely safe compared to lithium and that the supercapacitors are simpler to use than hydrogen. “Li-ion has significant fire risk both due to thermal runaway and the intensity of the fire, making it almost impossible to contain once ignited,” Dr Dalgleish said. “The fire risk for our supercapacitor batteries is extremely low.”",

         "Brain research technologies specialist Compumedics (ASX: CMP) has reached $20 million in sales for its magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in China. The latest $5.7m contract from Hangzhou Normal University follows the successful installation of a MEG system at Tianjin Normal University and further orders from Tsinghua and Tianjin universities. MEG is a neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain using highly sensitive detectors. Large, fast-growing market Compumedics global neuroimaging business director Gordon Haid said the new MEG contract firmly establishes the company’s position in the large and fast-growing Chinese neurosciences market. He said the university’s selection of Compumedics was the result of a lengthy technical evaluation of all available MEG systems from multiple vendors, with Compumedics’ long-term Chinese distributor Beijing Fistar conducting the sale . “MEG has enormous potential to increase our understanding of complex brain function, whether it is healthy or pathological,” Mr Haid added, saying that the company would now look to target the North American market. “The endorsement of now four prestigious universities serves as validation that our design is both groundbreaking and in high demand.” The company expects to ship the MEG system, along with CURRY neuroimaging software and an array of ancillary equipment, to Hangzhou in early 2026 after the completion of site preparations. Improvements incorporated Compumedics executive chair David Burton said the company continues to develop the Orion LifeSpan MEG with a number of improvements over earlier systems to be incorporated into all the new deliveries. These include sensor quality improvements and improved uniformity, an entirely new driver, more robust and accurate software, improved software convenience functions and data compatibility improvements. “The business opportunity is now gaining material commercial traction and we are now firmly on the path to significant commercialisation of our innovative MEG offering over the foreseeable future,” Mr Burton said.",

The unsolicited proposal has been lodged by the Robe River JV, made up of Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) (53%), Mitsui & Co (33%) and Nippon Steel Corporation (14%). If the offer is completed, CZR would retain its interests in other projects such as the Croydon gold project, the Buddadoo project and its 50% interest in the Ashburton Link project. Bidding war underway The bid for Robe Mesa comes a day after CZR received an unsolicited proposal from Gold Valley Iron Ore to acquire all CZR shares via an on-market takeover bid. On the same day, Fenix Resources (ASX: FEX) announced it had received acceptances from shareholders for 10.04% of all CZR shares in response to the conditional off-market takeover bid it had launched for the company in February. The CZR board has so far determined that the Gold Valley proposal does not constitute a superior offer compared to the binding offer from Fenix. Fenix offer favoured The CZR board continues to recommend the Fenix offer, with directors unanimously in favour of the proposal in the absence of a superior one. The Robe Mesa deposit is CZR’s cornerstone project with ore reserves of 33.4 million tonnes at 55.0% iron and a resource base of 45.2Mt at 56% iron. The project’s low strip ratio provides a low-capex direct shipping ore opportunity with a rapid, low-cost path to production. Debt funding consideration As part of its efforts to obtain the support of major shareholders, the Robe River JV would consider providing CZR with an equivalent amount of debt funding to that offered under the working capital loan provided by Fenix, along with a further amount equal to the break fee under the bid implementation agreement between CZR and Fenix Resources. After consultation with its external legal advisers, the CZR board has determined that the Robe River approach is a potential competing offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. As such, the CZR board intends to engage with Robe River JV in relation to its proposal.",

         "Gallium has become the darling of markets and Australian miners after a dramatic surge in demand and prices following China’s decision to halt its exports of the rare earth element (REE). Now analysts are suggesting terbium could follow a similar path after China, the world’s largest producer, removed it from its REE export list as well. Making up less than 1% of the total rare earth content in most deposits, terbium is one of the hardest elements to source. US defence demand Like gallium, terbium is heavily sought by the United States for its use in modern technologies and the defence sector. According to the US Department of Defense, terbium adds temperature resiliency to the neodymium iron boron magnets used in multiple key defence systems including aircraft, submarines and missiles. Various other technologies also use terbium, including as a green phosphor in display screens, a component in magnetostrictive alloys and a dopant in solid-state devices. Australian opportunity Alongside China, Australia, the US, India, Sri Lanka and Brazil currently mine terbium, with analysts estimating total reserves to be around 300,000 tonnes. Australia is currently estimated to contain 4% of the world’s REE reserves and has developed a growing interest in terbium to the point where it is now considered a pioneer in new terbium extraction methods. If those developments can be scaled up, analysts are expecting Australian technology to reduce costs and speed up the availability of terbium. Market Research Intellect valued the terbium market at around $7.8 billion in 2023 and is forecasting it to grow at an 11.15% compound annual rate to approximately $27.6b by 2031. Local terbium hunters Northern Minerals (ASX: NTU) is focused on becoming a producer of terbium and dysprosium at its Browns Range project in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Australian Strategic Materials (ASX: ASM) is looking to produce a suite of separated rare earth oxides with up to 15 rare earth elements, including terbium, at its “mines-to-metals” Dubbo project in New South Wales. Victory Metals (ASX: VTM) is developing a clay-hosted REE deposit that includes terbium in an emerging resource situated in the Cue region of WA.",

         "Arafura Rare Earths (ASX: ARU) has signed a binding 100-tonne-per-annum (tpa), five-year offtake agreement with commodity trader Traxys Europe. Arafura will supply Traxys with neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide from its Nolans project in Australia, with an option for a further 200tpa at Arafura’s discretion. Neodymium and praseodymium are two rare earth elements crucial for manufacturing strong permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and other technologies. Critical mineral supplier Luxembourg-headquartered Traxys has more than 20 offices across four continents, delivering critical materials to global supply chains to support the diversification and resilience of the rare earths market. The new agreement is conditional on the completion of construction and development of the Nolans project, the commencement of commercial production and ramp-up. The deal’s pricing is in US$ and contractual, broadly referencing the NdPr Ex Works China price. Nameplate target Managing director Darryl Cuzzubbo said the agreement builds on Arafura’s target of signing binding offtake sales for 80% of Nolans’ nameplate capacity of 4,440tpa, with the Traxys deal representing as much as 8% of that target. “With only 34% of the product from Nolans remaining to be marketed, our ongoing negotiations mean we are well positioned to reach our target,” Mr Cuzzubbo said. “This arrangement complements our global supply chain diversification strategy and highlights the desirability of securing product from a Tier 1 jurisdiction like Australia and a project like Nolans with globally recognised ESG credentials.” Additional NdPr volume Mr Cuzzubbo said the option to place additional NdPr volume will enable the company to effectively manage its annual contract supply commitments and the variability in product delivery schedules from its original equipment manufacturer and component manufacturing offtake customers. He added that the company continues to receive strong interest from a range of parties aligned with its offtake and investment strategy. Analysts are forecasting NdPr oxide prices to improve in 2025 due to a narrowing of the surplus and the potential for deficits driven by strong demand, particularly for NdFeB magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines.",

         "International Graphite (ASX: IG6) has received further validation of the potential of its Collie micronising plant in Western Australia, with front-end engineering and design (FEED) results identifying strong financial returns. Downstream processing at Collie is part of the company’s Australia-first mine-to-market capability. International Graphite plans to combine this with mining and graphite concentrate production from its 100%-owned Springdale graphite project in WA’s south. Expansion potential Estimates contained in the FEED study identified average sales revenue of approximately $14.1 million per annum. The study also confirmed the potential to expand production easily and significantly. It estimated a capital cost of $6.3m, incorporating building design, civil works, earthworks and other infrastructure capacity to facilitate a low-cost expansion. Strong economics “The economics for the Collie micronising facility are strong—successful implementation and a progressive expansion option would rank International Graphite as an international force in the industrial graphite market,” chief executive officer Andrew Worland said. “We believe the key to advancing graphite projects is through the control of value-adding industrial and battery anode downstream processing facilities.” “Our goal is to develop markets and generate early cash flow that will assist in the financing of our Springdale graphite project.” Production ramp-up A key component of the company’s Collie development and marketing strategy is the ability to pace a production ramp-up based on prevailing market conditions and customer requirements. The FEED study has identified the potential to almost double micronised graphite production, with average sales revenue increasing to around $28m per annum at an additional capital cost of approximately $1.7m. “We see the Collie development as a first step in the build-out of our Australian and international downstream industrial facilities,” Mr Worland said. Springdale test work A test work program undertaken in February by leading Japanese chemical processing specialists returned battery-grade purification results from concentrates sourced from the Springdale project. The program – co-ordinated by Japan’s Marubeni Corporation, one of the world’s biggest integrated trading and investment conglomerates – involved purifying graphite concentrates from drilling and bulk extraction undertaken at Springdale in 2023. Various wash cycle tests returned a purity of up to 99.97% total graphitic carbon, the purity generally specified for lithium-ion battery anode applications.",

         "Elevate Uranium (ASX: EL8) is on schedule to complete construction of the demonstration plant for development and potential commercialisation of its game-changing U-pgrade technology. Elevate developed U-pgrade in-house to capitalise on the company’s portfolio of near-surface uranium projects in Namibia and will initially used it to beneficiate ore from its Koppies project. The company intends to use the plant to confirm that the U-pgrade beneficiation process can remove gangue waste material and concentrate the uranium mineral into a low-mass, high-grade concentrate before leaching at a scalable size. Construction on schedule Elevate managing director Murray Hill said the design and construction of the plant are on schedule, and expects completion by the end of the first half of CY2025. Elevate awarded the contract for the construction of the containerised U-pgrade demonstration plant at Koppies to Fremantle Metallurgy in December 2024. Fremantle Metallurgy has extensive experience – including the construction of pilot plants for clients ranging from BHP Group (ASX: BHP) to junior resource companies – and the expertise to support the project. Factory acceptance testing Following construction completion, the plant will undergo factory acceptance testing in Perth before being containerised and shipped to Namibia to be reassembled and used to process at least 60 tonnes of Koppies ore. Mr Hill said results from the operation of the demonstration plant would inform the design of a full-scale commercial U-pgrade processing plant. “Our metallurgical team’s recent visit to Namibia was productive and we are moving forward with the necessary approvals,” he added. “We are excited about the potential of this demonstration plant to validate our U-pgrade process for the commercialisation of the Koppies uranium project.” Koppies project growth Elevate is also making good progress with resource growth drilling at its Namib IV target. While it was discovered in 2021, initial work at Namib IV was deferred in favour of the company’s highly successful drilling programs that would ultimately grow the Koppies resource to 66 million pounds. The current program is systematically testing the extent of mineralisation, with future infill drilling aimed at delineating a maiden resource in 2025. Namib IV is only 20 kilometres from the southern portion of the Koppies uranium project and additional resources from Namib IV will enhance the overall Koppies resource and may extend the mine life or increase production rates at any future mining operation at Koppies.",

         "Terra Uranium (ASX: T92) will take ownership of two high-grade exploration licences in the New England region of New South Wales via its proposed acquisition of private company LCT Metals. The licences house the historic Ottery tin mine, the Castle Rag silver project and the Mole River silver-tin project and will enable Terra to expand its exploration strategy beyond uranium for the first time. The company will retain its projects in Canada’s Athabasca Basin, which have been hailed as integral to taking advantage of an anticipated recovery in uranium prices. Expanded strategy Executive chair Andrew Vigar said the acquisition signified a turning point for Terra. “Terra’s exploration strategy has now been expanded from just uranium to tin, silver and gold in Australia,” he said. “While we will retain our valuable Canadian uranium assets, we have taken the option to make an acquisition in the prolific New England tin-silver-antimony-gold province.” “It is an exciting time for our company and we look forward to keeping shareholders informed of our progress at these new targets.” Acquisition terms Terra will issue LCT Metals with 2.44 million ordinary shares plus 1.22 million unlisted options at an exercise price of $0.09 each, expiring in December 2026. The consideration shares will be subject to voluntary lock-up periods of 25% for three months, 25% for six months and 50% for 12 months. Terra will also pay LCT Metals $40,000 in cash, comprising $20,000 as reimbursement for two refundable security deposits of $10,000 each. Largest tin producer The Ottery mine has been the largest historic hard-rock tin producer in the New England region, producing around 2,700 tonnes of tin oxide at an average grade of 2% during its lifetime. The mineralisation occurs in a series of five lodes hosted by an intrusive porphyry unit, surrounded by wide hydrothermal alteration zones. The Ottery tenement abuts the Taronga tin project owned by Metals X (ASX: MLX) subsidiary First Tin that BHP Group (ASX: BHP) and Newmont explored and developed towards a pre-feasibility study in the 1980s. Taronga is 10 kilometres from Ottery and has a current resource of 23.2 million tonnes grading 0.16% tin. High-grade samples The Castle Rag project encompasses a strike of over 7km in length and contains deposits at Castle Rag, Watt & Walkers, Southside Hill, McDonalds, Gilligans and Sully & Gilligans. Historical high-grade surface samples include 1,670 grams per tonne silver, along with 445g/t silver and 1.12% copper, while a rock chip sample collected 247m north of the Castle Rag boundary graded 15.2% copper, 0.59% lead and 3.98% zinc. Mole River is prospective for silver-rich polymetallic mineralisation, as demonstrated by numerous documented mineral occurrences across a potential 13km of strike. It contains more than 24 outcrops grading more than 30g/t silver with associated lead and zinc, as well as a separate tin zone with samples grading 64% tin, 12% tin, 5.21% tin and 3% tin oxide below 15m in shafts. Share placement Terra has received firm commitments from a number of sophisticated investors to raise $500,000 before costs by way of a placement priced at $0.04 per share. The company will issue a total of 12.5 million shares plus one free unquoted option for each new share and use the proceeds to fund the acquisition of LCT Metals and ongoing costs at the new exploration licences.

         "Federal opposition leader Peter Dutton has vowed to finally approve the push by Woodside Energy (ASX: WDS) to extend the life of its North West Shelf (NWS) gas project in Western Australia until 2070. During a visit to Perth today, Mr Dutton unveiled a proposal for fast-tracking the project while also supporting the development of the $30 billion Browse joint venture with Woodside, BP, and Japanese giant Mitsui. Woodside, which has long been seeking environmental approval for a 50-year extension to the NWS project, was most recently disappointed after Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek delayed a federal government environmental approval deadline until the end of March. Expedited consideration Mr Dutton announced to the Perth media that he would provide a go-ahead within 30 days of winning the upcoming federal election. “We would expedite consideration of the NWS project as a matter of urgency because, unlike Labor, we recognise its significance to the WA economy and the importance of secure and reliable gas supplies in pushing down energy prices,” he said. “It is of national importance that this project not be held up any longer by a government whose prime minister and minister would rather gain Greens votes in inner-city electorates than approve good economic projects for the energy security of our nation.” Major gas and LNG supply Located in WA’s Pilbara region, the NWS project has been producing gas and LNG for domestic and global customers for 40 years. Upon commencing production in 1984, the NWS became WA’s largest producer of pipeline gas, providing energy that fuelled the state’s commercial and industrial developments. The project’s Karratha gas plant is one of the most advanced integrated gas production systems in the world, producing LNG, domestic gas, condensate and LPG. Greens attack decision Greens spokesperson for the environment Senator Sarah Hanson-Young declared Mr Dutton was doing the bidding of the fossil fuel companies. “The NWS project extension is not in our national interest—Woodside’s gas greed would be an environmental disaster and Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek should have rejected it well before the upcoming federal election.” “This extension would unleash billions of tonnes of carbon pollution out to 2070, threatening cultural heritage at Murujuga and pristine ecosystems like Scott Reef, home to 33 threatened species such as the green sea turtle and the pygmy blue whale.” “Heavy shipping and drilling will also jeopardise whale migration pathways.”",

         "Resolution Minerals (ASX: RML) is preparing to fast-track exploration of its growing portfolio of antimony, one of the world’s “hottest” commodities. Resolution acquired the Drake East antimony-gold project in early March and considers it a highly prospective brownfields opportunity with historic antimony production. Fastmarkets reports that, since April 2024, antimony prices have risen at their fastest rate in over 40 years to reach record highs due to a severe supply shortage, with China having significantly cut its exports of the critical metal in recent years. Multiple antimony occurrences Drake East already hosts 14 known antimony occurrences including the well-documented Mosquito Creek antimony-gold reef, with occurrences covering a large area with a strike length of over 15 kilometres. The project also hosts more than 50 gold occurrences including a placer gold resource at Lanikai West. With prices of both metals remaining strong, Resolution has moved quickly to test the potential at Drake East. LiDAR survey contract The company has engaged Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) specialist GeoCloud Analytics to acquire data aimed at generating targets for further investigation and possible drilling. The interpretation of that data will help identify historic workings and geomorphological features (such as faults and shear zones) related to antimony and gold mineralisation. GeoCloud completed a similar interpretation for Legacy Minerals (ASX: LGM) on the adjacent project area, which resulted in over a 100% increase in the number of known historic mines and workings. More accurate results “The LiDAR interpretation will provide us with a truer indication of the extent of antimony mineralisation occurring at Drake East,” executive director Aharon Zaetz said. “As the market has seen with Legacy – in their case, a 100% increase in the number of known mine workings – this program for RML will not only confirm existing targets but will generate possible new targets.” The company anticipates that this work will greatly enhance the antimony prospectivity of the project by revealing, among other things, the extent of the antimony workings located at Drake East. Resolution announced earlier this month that it had received firm commitments for a $1.7 million placement of fully paid ordinary shares in the company to further develop the antimony acquisitions.",

Pulled together with support from marketing partner Cronimet, EQ Resources has executed the offtake contracts with leading international tungsten consumers. Following the new agreements, the company will supply approximately 25% of its production into Europe, 25% into North America and the balance into Asia. Top three producers EQ Resources chief executive officer Kevin MacNeill said the counterparties are among the top three producers in their respective markets, covering the production of ammonium paratungstate, tungsten oxide and tungsten carbide materials. “EQR’s global operations represent a significant part of the western supply of tungsten concentrate,” Mr MacNeill said. “We are pleased that we supply major western producers on a long-term basis while at the same time exploring ways to add value to our concentrate through the integration of downstream processing capacity.” Ex-Asia consumers Mr MacNeill said the recent export stoppage of various tungsten products from China made the agreements with North American and European consumers of even greater significance. “The recent move by China to more closely regulate the export of tungsten products has certainly triggered more interest in locking in volume supply of tungsten raw materials,” he said. The offtake contracts also come at a time of rising tungsten prices, with Fastmarkets APT Mid Price for the metal up 13% over the past 12 months. Export ban China announced supply control measures in mid-February 2025 that ultimately led to a complete halt in the country’s exports of the majority of tungsten products. “The global demand for tungsten is growing, and on our side, we are fully committed for the next two years at least,” Mr MacNeill said.

         "EMVision Medical Devices (ASX: EMV) has completed aeromedical retrieval environment testing of its First Responder proof-of-concept (PoC) device to treat rural patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The company used the world-first brain imaging device to collect a series of volunteer scans in remote settings in collaboration with the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) and the Australian Stroke Alliance. The results showed that First Responder was able to withstand the physical stress, environmental conditions and operational constraints unique to aeromedical retrieval. Transforming outcomes Affectionately known as the “scanner in the skies,” First Responder presents an opportunity to transform stroke and TBI outcomes for all patients, regardless of their location, by delivering immediate and sophisticated neurodiagnostic technology. Research shows that patients in rural and remote locations experience 17% more strokes than urban dwellers and receive less specialist stroke care due to the challenges of transport and distance. RFDS staff received preliminary training in the operation of the device and completed the scans under an existing ethics approval. Medical personnel have hailed urgent on-site brain imaging as a critical first step in the stroke treatment pathway. Field testing EMVision chief executive officer Scott Kirkland said the company was pleased to have taken the First Responder PoC device into the field for the first time. “Field testing is a key step in the First Responder development program and the learnings generated will inform progress from the current advanced prototype to production-equivalent commercial units,” he said. “We are excited by the opportunity to have a substantial positive impact in reducing the global burden of stroke.” New ethics application EMVision confirmed that a new ethics application was under review to allow RFDS staff to enrol and scan patients in a forthcoming workflow implementation study. RFDS, South Australian Ambulance Service’s emergency retrieval service MedStar, SA Health’s Rural Support Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital and the Australian Stroke Alliance will collaborate on the study. It will evaluate First Responder’s usability, reliability, functionality and workflow metrics to meet international regulatory requirements. Stroke study EMVision has made an additional ethics application to allow First Responder PoC scans during acute suspected stroke cases managed by Melbourne’s Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU). Approval will allow EMVision to collaborate with Australia’s only MSU and one of the few MSUs globally that participate in clinical research. Mr Kirkland said the work would evaluate the use of First Responder during pre-hospital emergency aid to suspected acute stroke patients while gathering contemporaneous ground-truth MSU CT scan data.",

The project aims to promote security measures in the Iraqi capital and will comprise the installation of a new surveillance camera solution managed by icetana’s video analytics software to monitor the streets. Proof-of-concept testing icetana will provide the software to High Tech’s Dubai-based subsidiary HTE Electronics Trading for deployment by the Baghdad Safe City project as the end user. The order comes after extensive proof-of-concept testing in Iraq, in which icetana’s software was able to demonstrate all the functionality required by the Baghdad Safe City project. This includes facial recognition, licence plate recognition for Arabic plates, fire and smoke detection, left luggage detection, trespass and loitering detection, people and vehicle counting, unauthorised access and the related detection of irregular movements and unusual directions. Perpetual licence The High Tech contract is priced on a perpetual licence basis at approximately $1.37m and includes a $344,000 service maintenance agreement fee for the first year. Should High Tech choose to renew the service agreement after the first year, it will incur an additional $344,000 fee per year. Licensing will begin once the software is implemented in May 2025. Growth opportunity icetana AI chief executive officer Kevin Brown said Iraq represented a large opportunity for the company’s additional growth. “This initial sale is the largest-value contract in our company’s listed history and is a significant milestone,” he said. “We believe it is an exciting time for icetana AI as our investments in the business bear fruit.”",

         "Axel REE’s (ASX: AXL) confidence that its Caladão project in Brazil will be one of the only rare earth element (REE) and gallium resources in the world has been boosted with further high-grade results in the fifth batch of assays. The high-grade gallium results continue to occur from surface as Axel moves ahead with metallurgical and inferred mineral resource estimate (MRE) studies. Highlighted REE mineralisation thicknesses in the latest tests included 49.92m at 5,909 parts per million total rare earth oxides from 27 metres. High-grade mineralisation The latest assays from Axel’s diamond and auger drill program at Caladão, located in Brazil’s Lithium Valley, have again returned consistent REE intercepts in the saprolite profile and gallium mineralisation in the lateritic soil profile at surface. “We are pleased with the results from our phase one drilling program at the Caladão project,” managing director Dr Fernando Tallarico said. “An important outcome of this set of assays is the extension of gallium mineralisation up to 5km beyond the Caladão granite into the leucogranite host rock, significantly expanding the mineralised area.” REE and gallium studies Axel engaged SRK Consulting in mid-February to commence an MRE program for both REE and gallium at Caladão. At the same time, the company contracted the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to begin metallurgical testing for both REE and gallium aimed at optimising leach recoveries, impurity removal and precipitation testing. The MRE at Caladão will initially cover a 35 square kilometre high-grade mineralised drilled section of Area A and will follow on with the 25 sq km mineralised zone at Area B. Auger drilling resumed Axel has resumed auger drilling at Caladão, where only 15% of the total project area has been drilled and is mineralised. The MRE will support optimal high-grade step-out and infill drilling zones for further resource confidence and scale expansion. China’s recent ban on gallium exports has made it a high-value critical metal of global strategic importance, currently priced at around $1,500 per kilogram.",

         "The launch of two excellent new diversified exchange traded funds (ETFs) by Vanguard is a great reminder that ETFs are not a simple set and forget investment. Whenever adding an ETF to an investment portfolio it is important to consider the sort of overlap it might have with other ETFs already in your portfolio and make adjustments when needed. New funds might fill some gaps The new funds, Vanguard diversified all growth index ETF (ASX: VDAL) and Vanguard diversified income ETF (ASX: VDIF) are well worth considering but only in the context how many gaps there are that you need to cover. Financial planners often notice that Australians who have invested in exchange traded funds hold double-ups, which means they could be paying unnecessary fees to get the same exposure. This is particularly the case of pure index funds such as those covering the ASX200 or the S&P 500. Many passive investors have double-ups A recent analysis of 71,730 investors’ portfolios by portfolio tracking tool Sharesight showed that of those invested in Vanguard’s ASX300 ETF (ASX: VAS), which tracks the ASX300, 6.5% had also invested in Betashares A200 ETF (ASX: A200) which tracks the ASX200). A further 3.7% were also invested in iShares’ ASX200 ETF (ASX: IOZ) and 1% were invested in all three. That means about one in ten investors in Australia’s biggest ETF is also invested in a near-identical product. The situation was similar in ETFs that cover the US market, with many investors holding a S&P 500 ETF such as Vanguard’s ASX: VOO and a NASDAQ ETF such as Betashares ASX: NDQ perhaps without realising the extent of the double up between those two. That concentration has only increased with the dominance of the technology giants across both US indices. Capital gains can be a good reason to double up They may be some very good reasons for such a double up with many ETF investors not wanting to generate a capital gain by selling off a long-standing ETF holding even if they’re buying a new ETF which may have lower fees. That could mean that they funnel all of their new investments into the cheapest ETF but still hang on to an earlier ETF purchase that may have had a lower management cost but has now been overtaken. In general, though, it’s not a good idea to buy multiple ETFs that offer the same or very similar coverage because it limits diversification or perhaps creates a misleading illusion of diversification and increases fees. What lies under the hood? Now to get back to the new Vanguard ETFs and see what lies under the hood. In the case of the Vanguard Diversified All Growth Index ETF (ASX: VDAL), it is designed for investors with a very high-risk tolerance seeking long-term capital growth. It gives total exposure to an amazing 6,000 or even more companies across the world offering growth including Australian equities, global equities, emerging markets and global small caps. That could certainly suit some investors who want exposure to global growth stocks in one neat package and all for a reasonable management fee of 0.27% a year. The Vanguard Diversified Income ETF (ASX: VDIF) is designed to suit investors looking for regular income with some capital growth potential, blending investment grade fixed income, corporate bonds, and high dividend yield equities. VDIF is highly diversified, with exposure to more than 12,000 securities, allocating 40% to defensive assets and 60% to growth assets, all for a management fee of 0.32% a year. Core holdings should be simple and easy to understand One of the best ways to think of ETFs is as a core holding so it is a good idea to only have a small number of core holdings, such as one covering the Australian ASX 200, another covering the S&P 500 and another covering major international share markets. Other ETFs might still find their way into your portfolio as satellite investments covering areas such as fixed interest, specialised areas or bonds but the core holding should remain quite simple and easy to understand. Holding too many overlapping ETFs can cause unwanted duplication, higher fees, and may give investors an unrealistic picture of their actual diversification which may only emerge when markets turn bearish.",

         "Greenland – long regarded as a difficult place to operate due to anti-mining governments and seemingly the current centre of attention for US President Donald Trump – may be about to change its stance on critical minerals developments. Commentators suggest that the election victory of the country’s centre-right opposition Demokraatit party and the defeat of the environmentally-focused Naleraq party will lead to the lifting of restrictions that have held back critical minerals developments. Previous Greenland governments have been largely opposed to resource development, frustrating miners who have identified significant critical minerals and uranium potential. Untapped potential A report from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland has confirmed that the country has substantial untapped potential for critical raw materials. These include rare earth metals, graphite, niobium, platinum group metals, molybdenum, tantalum and titanium—all of which are already or will become essential for the green transition. The country’s resources have attracted the attention of European leaders, Australian miners and President Trump, who recently threatened to take over Greenland to gain access to its mineral wealth. Kvanefjeld REE project Demokraatit’s victory is positive news for Australian miner Energy Transition Minerals (ASX: ETM) . The company continues to advance multiple workstreams to support the development of its large Kvanefjeld rare earth element (REE) project. There has been a noted surge in media and investor interest in Kvanefjeld following President Trump’s remarks. Company visit Key members of the company’s board and senior leadership team visited Greenland in early February. The trip was planned to strengthen trust and collaboration, while promoting the company’s message that the development of Kvanefjeld would deliver tangible economic and social benefits for the community while aligning with Greenland’s environmental and sustainability goals. The company’s wholly owned Greenlandic subsidiary – which holds the Kvanefjeld exploration licence – is actively engaged in arbitration and litigation against the governments of Greenland and Denmark concerning delays to the project.",

         "Advance Metals (ASX: AVM) has reported multiple zones of visible gold in three holes from a maiden diamond drilling campaign at the Happy Valley target, which sits at the south-eastern end of its Myrtleford project in Victoria. Advance believes these are the most significant gold it has observed in its exploration program, extending the known strike of the Happy Valley system. The company is now planning a fourth diamond hole to assess the continuity of the gold system. Previous intersection The company’s first hole in February delivered encouraging results when it intersected at least three discrete zones of sulphide-bearing quartz veining with visible mineralisation. The lowermost of these veins extended over 3.35 metres and contained multiple occurrences of fine-grained gold throughout the interval. All zones appeared to correlate with previous gold intersections from above and below this hole. Similar mineralisation Advance has now completed the final two holes (AMD002 and AMD003) and confirmed that both intersected similar mineralisation in multiple down-hole zones. AMD002 tested approximately 15m below a historic drill hole that returned an interval of 11.5m at 160.4 grams per tonne gold and visible gold at 211.5m, 216m, 216.2m, 217.6m and 219.2m. The company drilled AMD003 in a new area and it intersected strong visible mineralisation at 159.5m, 180m and 180.9m. ‘Productive’ campaign Managing director Dr Adam McKinnon said the maiden drilling campaign at Myrtleford was proving to be “incredibly productive”. “We now have three holes completed, with each producing highly encouraging visible gold mineralisation in multiple zones,” he said. “As usual, we have to be cautious and wait for analytical results to fully confirm the results, but I am very happy with what we have seen to date.” New area along strike “The visual results from AMD003 are particularly significant, given the hole was sited in a new area along strike to the west of previous drilling,” Dr McKinnon added. “It has produced the strongest visual gold mineralisation of our program to date and expands the length of the system.” The company expects the return of “multiple rounds” of assays in the coming months, and will follow further drilling at Happy Valley with shallow work at the Twist Creek prospect in Myrtleford’s northern section.",

         "dorsaVi (ASX: DVL) has launched a first-in-class 3D motion analysis test for the early identification and prevention of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes. The commercially available knee assessment tool employs advanced artificial intelligence capabilities within the company’s wearable sensor technology to identify unique movement patterns linked to ACL injury risk. The company believes the 3D knee assessment test represents a major advancement over industry-standard one-dimensional (1D) force plates, which measure vertical force but fail to capture the critical rotational torque forces that place athletes at risk. Proactive prevention dorsaVi chief executive officer Dr Andrew Ronchi said the innovation brings real-time laboratory-grade analysis into the hands of clinicians and coaches, enabling proactive injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies at scale. “Our AI-driven 3D motion analysis offers unprecedented accuracy in assessing knee mechanics in the clinic, which is something the industry has never had access to outside of biomechanics labs,” he said. Real-time feedback eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming lab assessments, while actionable insights from a large dataset of knee assessments allow practitioners to benchmark an athlete’s movement against established norms and intervene before injury occurs. “We believe this innovation will become the new standard in ACL injury prevention and rehabilitation, delivering tangible benefits for athletes, teams and clinicians worldwide.” Major challenge ACL injuries represent a major challenge for athletes, sports teams and healthcare providers worldwide, as they often require lengthy rehabilitation and costly surgical intervention and can cost millions of dollars in lost player time. More than 200,000 ACL injuries are recorded each year in the US alone across a range of sports, at an estimated annual cost of $7 billion. Until now, accurately measuring knee rotation and torque — key risk factors for ACL tears — has only been possible in specialised biomechanics labs. Dr Ronchi said the company would also target broader musculoskeletal health applications associated with cost-saving preventative injury screening by insurers and employers.",

         "Godolphin Resources (ASX: GRL) has expanded the known mineralisation at its promising Lewis Ponds gold, silver and base metals project with new high-grade gold results. A five-hole, 1,094.8m drilling campaign completed in late January 2025 has intersected multiple mineralised zones outside the current mineral resource estimate. Highlight hits included 51.75m at 1.81 grams per tonne gold equivalent from 276.05m, including an internal high-grade core of 7.85m at 5.37g/t. Metallurgical test focus Managing director Jeneta Owens said Godolphin’s focus would be on selecting samples for a metallurgical test work program designed to identify concentrates that can be produced from Lewis Ponds and maximise the payability of the project’s gold and silver resource. “Lewis Ponds is an exceptional asset and our confidence in the project has continued to strengthen with every drill hole reported from this program,” Ms Owens said. “The results from the company’s most recent drill program have confirmed the potential upside for Lewis Ponds and this latest drill hole reiterates this result.” New area of mineralisation The latest drilling has identified a new area of mineralisation located in the hanging wall of the deposit, as well as a number of high-grade zones in the Torphy’s and Spicer’s lodes. “These, alongside numerous untested geophysical features proximal to the Lewis Ponds mineralisation, provide significant scope for future exploration initiatives,” Ms Owens said. Godolphin is sending its geological team to the site to commence field work and explore the surface areas where it has identified some of these features. The company expects production of a viable precious metals concentrate will unlock significant value from Lewis Ponds, with previous test work focused on producing base metal concentrates. Development pathway Godolphin is preparing to undertake metallurgical testing over the next few months to provide an understanding of the development pathway for Lewis Ponds, which is located in the Lachlan Fold Belt in New South Wales. The company is well funded after its recent share purchase plan (SPP) raised an additional $614,000. Godolphin targeted $300,000 from the SPP but received a total of 68 separate applications to more than double the amount raised.",

         "The saying that there are lies, damned lies and statistics is perhaps a reflection of the way statistics are misused by politicians and others rather than a critique of them. After all, accurate measurement is vital in implementing strong analysis and good policies. The value of good statistics is shown by the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia report (HILDA) which backs up many suspicions about what has been happening in Australian society. The report has been produced by interviewing the same 17,000 people across more than 9,000 households every year since 2001 to find out trends across the population. Some of the survey’s findings are wholly unsurprising, particularly the fact that men do a lot less work around the house than women and yet are quite happy for that situation to continue. Other findings such as the decline in attendance for most organised religions and the despair felt by women about the burden they bear doing household chores and caring for sick and elderly relatives also back up common perceptions. Economic inequality marching higher To me one of the most interesting parts of the latest HILDA survey is the way in which economic inequality in Australia has increased over time. Indeed, economic inequality in Australia has now reached the highest levels since the HILDA surveys began with more than half or 51.2% of respondents saying that their real income has fallen between 2021 and 2022. The interesting wrinkle in the findings is that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the support governments offered to Australians actually helped to reduce inequality in 2020. What followed on from that was two years in which inequality greatly worsened. Living standards falling for middle and lower income groups In 2021, there was a $7,542 difference between the mean and median individuals’ household equivalised income. That rose to $9,472 in 2022, suggesting the gap between the middle and upper classes was growing more quickly. Equivalised income is a measure of living standards, calculated by adjusting household income to account for the size and needs of the household. Professor Roger Wilkins, lead author and co-director of the HILDA survey, found that after the initial equalising effect of the pandemic, higher incomes in Australia grew faster relative to middle incomes. “At the same time, the relative growth of lower incomes has declined, which drives inequality up and makes it harder for poorer Australians to move into higher income groups,” said Professor Wilkins. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, the very opposite of what the Australian ethos of a fair go would suggest. Gini out of the bottle Another measure of what was happening is shown by the movement in what is known as the Gini coefficient – an ingenious measure which shows overall inequality in various societies. In 2022, the Gini coefficient rose to 0.321 — the first time it has ever been above 0.31 in the entire history of the HILDA survey. There are some possible reasons for this growing inequality, some of them demographic and others situational. The statistically large baby boomer demographic have been progressively moving into retirement, which has shielded them from some of the variation within incomes and has exposed their relatively lower taxed wealth gained through property ownership and also through growing superannuation accounts. This is a likely interpretation of the fact that non-elderly couples were the only family group to experience consistent growth in their median equivalised income since before the COVID-19 pandemic Secondly, investments in both the share market and property were generally buoyant in the couple of years after the pandemic, also leading to greater capital earnings by wealthier households because of their greater exposure to these asset classes. The Gini score ranges from zero in which everyone in society is equal and one where one person earns their country’s entire income. While Australia scored its worst ever Gini score, we are still a relatively egalitarian society compared to many other countries around the world. South Africa the worst for inequality while Slovenia reigns Some of the other countries that are less equal than Australia as measured by the Gini score include all of the countries in southern Africa, with South Africa taking out the gold medal as the most unequal in the world, all of South America and most of North America, with the notable exception of Canada. The worst countries following on from South Africa were Namibia, Suriname, Zambia, Sao Tome and Principe. Perhaps surprisingly, we are more equal in economic terms then people in China and Russia although there are some better performers then us in parts of Europe. In theory, communist countries should perform well on financial equality but these figures show that their rhetoric is perhaps not matched by the efficiency of their income redistribution. Iceland, Sweden and Japan beating us The Scandinavian countries and Japan score better on the equality stakes than Australia, with Slovenia the world’s most equal country and many of the former Soviet states also performing well on this measure. Following on from Slovenia as the most equal country were the Czech Republic, Belarus, Moldova, the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belgium and Finland. In some ways a good Gini score is a reflection of the success of the taxation system and other forms of redistribution of wealth, while poor scores often reflect the presence of an extremely wealthy elite such as very lightly taxed billionaires and oligarchs. Of course, the interesting thing about statistics is how they are used. It would be easy enough to say we could do better to produce a more equal society and study what had made those countries with a better Gini score than us successful. However, a more likely political outcome might be to just shrug and say we are doing better than much of the world and do nothing.",

         "The global nickel market is facing new turmoil, with the world’s two top producers considering significant financial and production changes. Indonesia is proposing major cuts to nickel mining quotas and considering raising royalties paid by mining companies. Meanwhile, the Philippines – currently second to Indonesia in annual nickel production – is proposing an ore export ban. Leading nickel producer Indonesia produced an estimated 2.2 million metric tonnes of nickel in 2024, making it the leading global producer with over 50% of the world’s nickel mine production. The Indonesian government’s proposed nickel mining quota cuts will potentially lower the amount of ore mined from 272 million tonnes in 2024 to as little as 150Mt in 2025. At the same time, officials are proposing raising the royalty rates paid by miners and producers of metal products, as well as introducing rates of between 14% and 19% for nickel. Chinese backing The China-backed ramp-up of Indonesian production has significantly impacted global nickel markets—particularly in Australia, where a number of projects have stalled. The Indonesian government has said it aims to support nickel prices, which have been declining due to increased supply and weakening demand from battery makers and the stainless steel industry. Analysts estimate that the move could cut global nickel supply by as much as 35%. Philippines export ban Philippine lawmakers introduced a bill in February to ban raw nickel ore exports, aiming to encourage domestic value-added processing and replicate neighbouring Indonesia’s success in downstreaming its nickel resources. However, the powerful Philippines Nickel Industry Association (PNIA) says the move has been made at the wrong time. PNIA has urged the government to reconsider the ore export ban, stressing that the country must first create a competitive environment to attract investments in value-added processing before implementing restrictive policies. It has also called for swift action to seize global nickel opportunities, highlighting that the country risks falling behind as competitors ramp up production and attract foreign investments.",

         "Donaco International (ASX: DNA) has agreed to a proposed $55.6 million takeover by substantial shareholder On Nut Road, a special purpose vehicle managed by Hong Kong’s Argyle Street Management. A binding scheme implementation deed signed between the two companies will offer each Donaco shareholder a consideration of $0.045 cash per Donaco share held, representing a premium of 54.10% to the 90-day volume-weighted average price of $0.029 at 14 March. Donaco’s board of directors has unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the scheme. Cyclical business Donaco non-executive chair Porntat Amatavivadhana said the takeover would provide shareholders with certainty in the form of a cash payment while removing the risks associated with the cyclical nature of the entertainment business. “While our company has performed steadily in the last few years and has emerged from the pandemic, our financial headwinds have been compounded due to limited profit margins and a lack of substantial investor confidence [and] this has made fundraising efforts for any form of growth particularly challenging,” he said. “The dependence on a single major shareholder for financial stability becomes even more critical in light of the economic strains brought about by the pandemic.” Further challenges New gaming legislation in the company’s main region of operation could result in further challenges. “Thailand’s plan to introduce casino franchises in Bangkok could significantly impact the flow of patrons to our border casinos,” Mr Amatavivadhana said. The company also believes the recent actions to cut power along certain towns between Thailand and Cambodia that have led to intermittent power supply further complicate  operating conditions and will impact costs. Largest asset Donaco’s largest asset is the Star Vegas casino and hotel complex, billed as the largest, most luxurious and most successful resort in the Cambodian city of Poipet. Established in 1999, Star Vegas has 385 hotel rooms, as well as more than 150 gaming tables and 1,000 slot machines. The property is located on the border between Thailand and Cambodia and is the closest legal gaming destination to the greater Bangkok area. Boutique casino Donaco’s also owns the five-star Aristo hotel and boutique casino in northern Vietnam, located on the border with Yunnan province in south-western China. The property – which opened in 2002 – has 400 hotel rooms, multiple gaming tables and a licence allowing up to 300 electronic gaming machines. Donaco is a pioneer casino operator in the region and owns a 95% interest in Aristo in a joint venture with Vietnam’s government. Licensed fund manager On Nut Road was founded in 2002 as a licensed fund manager and currently manages more than US$2 billion of assets. Argyle Street Management, reportedly controlled by Thai hotel billionaire Chanin Donavanik, first invested in Donaco through On Nut Road in 2019. The company currently has a beneficial interest in approximately 12.84% of Donaco’s issued capital.",

         "Vintage Energy (ASX: VEN) has achieved some early success with workover activities at its Odin-1 and Vali-1 gas fields in central Australia. Operating on behalf of a joint venture with Metgasco and Bridgeport, Vintage has been undertaking flowline debottlenecking operations at the Southern Flank gas projects. The company is conducting the programs in an attempt to achieve more stable production from the field. Back-pressure reduction The workover program has so far managed to reduce back-pressure, which relates to pressure buildup encountered by gas as it flows through a system. This is often due to restrictions or equipment and impacts production efficiency. Vintage expects the reduction to enable it to recover a greater volume of gas per well moving forward. Immediate effect The workover has already led to an increase in the raw gas production from Odin and Vali to 3.6 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d), compared to 3.2MMscf/d immediately prior to the commencement of the operations. The company has also been addressing scaling, which had previously been identified as a major issue leading to declining gas production. Vintage believes the subsequent chemical injection and cleaning have rectified the interference with accurate metering previously reported. Scale management Vintage commenced chemical injection at Odin in February, aimed at managing the level of scale accumulation. Since the injection program commenced, production rates from the well have been generally stable and demonstrated a consistency that was not present while the meter was affected by scale accumulation. Managing director Neil Gibbins said the mitigation measures have yielded a strong start to the year and provided a good base for a proposed production uplift program being planned for April. “The response to pressure optimisation is welcome, as has been the ongoing performance of Odin-1 post scale management,” Mr Gibbins said.",

         "Many Peaks Minerals (ASX: MPK) has identified a high-grade gold shoot and a substantial extension to mineralisation during initial drilling at its Ferké project in Côte d’Ivoire. The company completed six holes for a total of 1,285 metres over approximately 760m of strike along the Ouarigue South prospect, which hosts high-grade gold mineralisation from the surface. Many Peaks sees the results as confirmation of Ferké’s potential for significant growth in scale from substantial extensions to gold mineralisation and increasing grades at Ouarigue South. Best intersections The new shoot returned best intersections of 11 metres at 2.16 grams per tonne gold from 53m and 45m at 8.58g/t gold from 104m including 25m at 14.8g/t gold from 116m and 7m at 1.58g/t gold from 153m. The company believes these results indicate continuity of gold values higher than 10g/t over a strike extent of more than 120m at Ouarigue South. They complement earlier drill holes, which assayed 47m at 3.72g/t gold from the surface including 14m at 10.7g/t gold from 33m and 54.17m at 1.88g/t gold from 59.58m, including 6.75m at 10.4g/t gold from 107m. ‘Previously unidentified zone’ “Our exploration team is delighted with the early success in our company’s maiden diamond campaign at Ferké, particularly in the previously unidentified structural zone, which has the potential to represent a high-grade shoot within the already high-grade mineralised intrusion at Ouarigue,” managing director Travis Schwertfeger said. “Drilling also achieved our objective of extending gold mineralisation at Ouarigue along strike and down plunge of previous high-grade gold intersections.” “We are encouraged by the plethora of targets this round of drilling has generated, which has seen us rapidly accelerate further diamond drilling at the new discovery.” Follow-up drilling Mr Schwertfeger said the company was planning a diamond core program to drill for extensions to the newly intersected shoots and commence delineation work. Many Peaks expects to complete the follow-up program in the coming weeks alongside reverse circulation (RC) drilling. The RC program will include shallow, systematic exploration of the Ouarigue extension targets with a focus on establishing bulk tonnage potential at Ferké.",

         "Tambourah Metals (ASX: TMB) has completed a new reverse circulation (RC) drilling program at the Tambourah King lode system as it continues an aggressive examination of its Tambourah gold project in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. The company’s latest drilling tested a section below a hole it diamond drilled in 2024 that indicated good potential for the definition of high-grade gold mineralisation. The 2024 diamond hole hit 2.65 metres at 32.3 grams per tonne gold from 58.35m, including 1.05m at 77.4g/t gold from 59.05m. Testing King lode Tambourah commenced this latest RC drilling program at the King lode system in early March 2025 with the secondary aim of in-filling the existing drill coverage along strike. To date, the company has traced approximately 300m of the system. 11 holes have successfully intersected the quartz lode structure. WA government support The company is using a WA government co-funded drilling grant of up to $180,000 to support the Tambourah King campaign. The drilling program has initially focused on the Tambourah King and Western Chief lodes and is still to test multiple workings at the site. Tambourah now plans to expand the drilling coverage at the project to test areas it believes have previously been ineffectively explored. Sizeable gold strike The Tambourah goldfield extends over 3 kilometres and comprises a series of sub-parallel, northerly striking, steeply dipping quartz lodes, often within a wider halo of carbonate alteration. The field has historic production of 5,445 tonnes for 148 kilograms of gold, equating to a 27.35 grams per tonne gold head grade. The company is looking to extend the areas of known gold mineralisation at Tambourah, both along strike and beneath shallow workings, with its ongoing drilling campaigns.",

         "Altech Batteries (ASX: ATC) has received environmental and construction approval under Germany’s Federal Emission Control Act (BImSchG) for its new CERENERGY GridPack sodium-chloride solid-state battery manufacturing plant in Saxony. The approval will allow German subsidiary Altech Batteries GmbH to finalise project funding and commence site clearing and construction for the 120-megawatt-hour facility. Environmental risk impacts determine the process for such applications, with most projects falling under the jurisdiction of BImSchG for federal approval. Permit application Altech submitted an application for a construction and operating permit and licence to German authorities in September 2023. The company made the application in collaboration with engineering subcontractor Leadec Services and architecture and balance-of-plant subcontractor Arikon AG. Altech conducted the permit and licence process in parallel with the CERENERGY definitive feasibility study to minimise delays in project execution once financing is secured. Final approval Group managing director Iggy Tan said he was pleased to have received the final licensing approval for the CERENERGY project so early. “Our approach of being dynamic, quick-moving and running things concurrently puts Altech in good stead to now complete the financing process ,” he said. “We appreciate the authorities’ recognition of our professional and responsible approach and we are thankful for their exceptional support.” High degree of confidence Mr Tan said the BImSchG approval would provide potential lenders with a higher degree of confidence in the project. Altech distributed a funding invitation document to various financial institutions worldwide in late 2024, receiving strong initial interest from 10 commercial banks and two venture debt funds. The company plans to work with its funding adviser to shortlist the most suitable financial partners. Sustainable alternative The CERENERGY project is at the forefront of next-generation sodium-chloride battery development, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional lithium-ion technology. CERENERGY batteries are fireproof and explosion-proof, with a lifespan of more than 15 years and the ability to operate in extreme cold and desert climates. The batteries use table salt and are free of lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper, eliminating exposure to critical metal price rises and supply chain concerns.",

         "Australia’s share market decoupled from Wall Street on Friday to record a rare daily gain but still could not avoid another weekly loss as tariff fears continued to roil markets. Wall Street declined to reach a 10% technical correction after President Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on wine from the European Union in retaliation for a 50% levy on American whiskey but Australian shares headed in the opposite direction thanks mainly to a rally in Australian iron ore and gold mining stocks. Our market was also boosted by news that the United States may have avoided a government shutdown after an earlier stalemate in the Senate – news that sent US futures higher. The ASX 200 rose 0.5%, or 40.6 points, to close at 7789.7 points, marking the first positive day since Monday. It wasn’t hard to discern the overall direction for the week though, with the index falling almost 2%. Miners ride rising iron ore price higher A rise in Singapore iron ore futures which climbed 1.3% to US$103.55 a tonne saw all of the big miners gaining value. BHP shareholders (ASX: BHP) enjoyed a 1.1% rise to $38.65, Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) rose 1% to $117.10 and Fortescue (ASX: FMG) rose 2.7% to $16.27. Gold miners shared the positive glow, after the shiny metal hit a new record of $US2990.02 an ounce after enjoying the best week of price gains for the year. Shares in Newmont (ASX: NEM) rose an impressive 5.7% to $73.43 while Regis Resources (ASX: RRL) jumped by 5.6% to $3.56. By the end of trade seven of 11 sectors were up, with utilities and miners recording the best of the gains. Banks shedding value Things were not so positive for the banking sector with Commonwealth Bank (ASX: CBA) shares falling 1.1% to $142.36. Shares in its Sydney rival Westpac (ASX: WBC) also fell 0.1%, ANZ (ASX: ANZ) shares also fell 0.2% but NAB (ASX: NAB) shares were the best of the bunch, up 0.3%. ANZ announced a partnership with the Australian government that will support its long-term commitment to Pacific banking, with the government agreeing to provide a guarantee worth up to $2 billion over the next decade to assist it in maintaining its Pacific network. Energy stocks were also weaker with shares in sector leader Woodside Energy (ASX: WDS) down 1.4% to $22.38. Amid some of the more notable moves, shares in A2 Milk (ASX: A2M) posted a strong gain, up 8.8% to $8.65, on predictions that Chinese officials will soon announce measures to boost consumption. The company’s milk sales in China have been growing strongly. Management shake up buoys Myer Shares in retailer Myer (ASX: MYR ) jumped 1.4% to 75¢ after executive chair Olivia Wirth restructured the retailer’s executive team. Lithium miner Liontown Resources (ASX: LTR) saw its shares rise 4.9% to 65¢ after it narrowed its losses in the half-year to December and geared up to resume underground production. Gold miner Catalyst Metals (ASX: CYL) shares rallied 5.2% to $4.64 after starting production at its Plutonic East site in Western Australia, extracting ore on time and within budget. Small cap stock action The Small Ords Index fell 1.68% for the week to 3004.3 points. ASX 200 vs Small Ords The week ahead In Australia, job figures out on Thursday are expected to see the local economy add about 30,000 new jobs in February, with the unemployment rate set to remain steady at 4.1%. Globally it is a big week for central banks with the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee expected to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%. The Bank of Japan is expected to sit on its hands and hold rates steady on Wednesday after it raised its benchmark interest rate in January well the Bank of England is also expected to keep things steady when it announces its rate decision on Thursday. Another release to watch during the week his Chinese monthly economic activity data with retail spending expected to increase along with industrial production and fixed asset investment although domestic demand is expected to stay subdued. Apart from the economic releases, President Trump’s continuing release of new tariff barriers is obviously the main market moving event. THIS WEEK’S TOP STOCKS",

         "A number of commodity analysts are confident that gold prices will continue to reach new levels in 2025. The gold price touched a record high overnight and is currently trading around US$2,999 per ounce on the back of reports of modest US inflation growth and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff strategy. The changing financial landscape and the potential for the US Federal Reserve to consider a rate cut this year have led several Wall Street analysts to raise their price targets. Boosted inflation expectations Leading financial institution Macquarie Group is now forecasting that gold will reach US$3,500/oz in the third quarter. “Year to date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations,” Macquarie head of commodities strategy Marcus Garvey wrote in a note. “President Trump’s rapid move to announce, if not always to enact, import tariffs has contributed to geopolitical uncertainty and boosted inflation expectations.” “[This has helped] push down front-end real rates and support gold in the face of periodic US dollar strength and initially reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts.” Broad-based uncertainty French universal bank BNP Paribas has suggested gold would move above US$3,100/oz in the second quarter. “The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realignment of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold,” BNP senior commodities desk strategist David Wilson suggested. Goldman Sachs also recently forecast that the price of the precious metal would hit US$3,100/oz by the end of 2025. Central bank demand Goldmans analyst Lina Thomas noted that the price of gold had surged more than 40% since the start of January 2024, repeatedly shattering records. Ms Thomas expects the rally in gold to continue on the back of demand from central banks. Goldman Sachs research also anticipates increased purchases of gold exchange-traded funds will boost the gold price, with declining interest rates helping make gold a more attractive investment.",

         "Speciality gas developer Renergen (ASX: RLT) has hit a major milestone with the maiden sale of liquid helium from its Virginia gas project in South Africa. The company was forced to inform shareholders in February that it had not entered business rescue discussions after questions were raised over issues surrounding its helium production and a legal dispute with a neighbour. Those challenges have caused the company’s share price to plunge by almost half over the past 12 months—today’s sales news has seen it rebound by 5% in morning trade. Hurdles overcome The prominent South African energy company has now solved one of the outstanding issues after completing the long-awaited filling of a helium container with liquid and having it collected by a customer. Chief executive officer Stefano Marani said the company had recently implemented an effective alternative solution to overcome the challenges of integrating large iso-containers to the extreme temperature needed for liquid helium storage. Renergen now utilises smaller Dewar containers – which have a capacity of between 250 and 500 litres – that Mr Marani said it will continue to use until its plant moves closer to nameplate capacity. “Our operations team has poured their hearts and souls into overcoming these technical challenges [and] successfully managing cryogenic liquid at -269 degrees Celsius is a remarkable accomplishment achieved by very few companies worldwide.” Exceeding minimum specifications Mr Marani said the quality of both its LNG and liquid helium now exceeds minimum design specifications. “This achievement represents a concrete step toward rebuilding the trust placed in us—a commitment we take seriously,” he said. “We remain committed to restoring confidence through consistent delivery and performance as we continue to advance the Virginia gas project.” The company is also confident that it will be successful in its legal appeal against the neighbouring Springbok solar project’s move to commence construction within its petroleum production right.",

         "Boss Energy’s (ASX: BOE) investment in the Alta Mesa uranium project in Texas continues to pay off, with further positive news overnight from partner enCore Energy. Boss expanded its global plans in February 2024 with the $92 million acquisition of a 30% stake in the Alta Mesa in situ recovery uranium project from enCore. Since that time, enCore has successfully commenced production at Alta Mesa and continues to ramp up activities aimed at achieving a targeted annualised production rate of 1.5 million pounds of uranium. New IX circuit initiated As part of that ramp-up, the US-based uranium developer has now started up a second ion exchange (IX) circuit at the Alta Mesa central processing plant. IX circuits collect uranium from process water pumped from recovery wells in the well-field. The new IX circuit doubles the total flow capacity from 2,500 gallons per minute (GPM) to 5,000GPM, with flow rate an essential factor in expanding the amount of uranium captured. Additional rigs to come The Alta Mesa central processing plant is currently running at approximately 75% of its total designed flow rate capacity due to well-field development activities and enCore is aiming to improve the development rate by expanding drill rig capacity. In conjunction with the expansion of processing capacity, enCore has installed additional injection and extraction wells in the currently permitted and operational well-field. enCore will bring additional wells online systematically in order to reach capacity and increase uranium capture at the processing plant. The company is also progressing the development of a third IX circuit at Alta Mesa, which it is targeting to bring online in 2026. ‘Important phase’ “Sequencing well-fields as part of a ramp-up of new processing circuits, as experienced by our operating partners enCore at present on the Alta Mesa project, is an important phase for in situ recovery uranium mines,” Boss managing director Duncan Craib said. “We remain encouraged by enCore’s program of work in addressing these issues.” enCore executive chair William Sheriff said the company expects to add 13 recovery wells over the next six weeks. “While we are pleased to see the second IX circuit operating, we look forward to full utilisation of this increase in capacity,” Mr Sheriff said. “With additional drill rigs and accelerated effort, we look forward to the steady advancement of our uranium capture rates.”",

         "Hot Topics",
         "[]",
         "Australia’s super system is now so successful that other countries are looking to copy it. The key difference with our system – and the reason it will soon support some of the richest retirees in the world – is that it is a defined contribution rather than a defined benefit system. That can leave some retirees worried about the eventual amount they will retire with but it also allows for a more aggressive investment performance over time, which results in startlingly better outcomes. For example, calculations by the Super Members Council show that our super assets will surpass the UK’s in 2030 and Canada’s by 2031. Heading for number two in the world That would put our national nest egg into second place around the world behind the United States, even though in population terms we sit at number 55. The analysis also showed that between 2001 and 2023, Australia’s cumulative superannuation contributions were the highest among OECD countries and were well above the OECD average. One of the really strong benefits flowing from that is that our spending on the age pension is actually falling and should continue to fall, even as our super system keeps growing at double the rate of most international competitors. Some serious interest in the US The recent “super summit” in Washington attracted some serious interest from US players including including Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Australian treasurer Jim Chalmers, US ambassador Kevin Rudd and a host of executives from Australia’s banks and superannuation providers. Unlike Australia, the US social security system for all workers is a major drag on government spending, with the large retiring Baby Boomer cohort drawing down en masse and with the majority of that money having being invested in poorly performing government bonds. When you include private pensions the US is in a much better position but not when you look across different socio-economic groups, given that many private “top up” pensions belong to wealthier workers. Big investors welcome Of course, the other reason that the US is interested in superannuation is that Australian super funds are increasingly invested in the massive US share market, with the current  $US400 billion of assets expected to double over the next decade to $US1 trillion. That makes Australia a seriously big investor in the US and worth courting. Australian superannuation assets have jumped an incredible 500% over the last 20 years and they are spread across the majority of the workforce due to super payments being withdrawn directly from pay packets. Looking at the full picture Australia’s superannuation assets reached more than US$2.6 trillion ($4.2tn) at the end of 2024, making it fifth largest out of 22 global pension systems in the 2025 Global Pension Assets Study. The US has the biggest market with US$38 trillion ($60.6tn) in retirement savings, followed by Japan and Canada with US$3.3 trillion ($5.3tn) respectively, and the UK with US$3.1 trillion ($5tn). Australia closing in on number one The lea ding country with the highest ratio of pension assets to GDP is Switzerland at an amazing 152% but Australia is not far behind with 146%. Our super system continues to grow faster than others, mainly due to our above average equity allocations which is at 52% compared to 50% for US funds. By contrast, the Netherlands, UK, and Japan have above-average exposure to bonds, while Switzerland has the most-balanced allocation. The countries with higher defined contribution rankings are growing their pension pools the fastest, with Australia topping the defined contribution rankings with 89.2% of assets, followed by the US (69%) and Canada (44%). After the success of the super summit in Washington, Sydney will stage another global superannuation summit in the second half of this year.",

         "Global zinc prices have risen on news that leading global zinc producer Nyrstar is planning to cut around 25% of output from its 280,000-tonnes-per-year Tasmanian smelter. Zinc prices are sitting at US$2,936 per pound after Nyrstar revealed it was reducing production at its Hobart zinc operations from April 2025 until further notice. Nyrstar Hobart general manager Todd Milne said the company decided to make the move following an extensive review of its operations and as a direct response to deteriorating market conditions and financial losses being sustained by Nyrstar Australia. Financial challenges Mr Milne added that Nyrstar’s Australian assets continue to face significant financial challenges due to various external factors including worsening conditions in raw material markets, negative treatment charges and increased costs. The Nyrstar Hobart zinc smelter is one of the world’s largest in terms of volume, targeting high-value-added products for export primarily to Asia. The facility is closely integrated with Nyrstar Australia’s Port Pirie multi-metals smelter, which processes Hobart’s paragoethite by-product as well as other leach by-products. Nyrstar is owned by global commodity trader and supply chain logistics company Trafigura. No job cuts planned Mr Milne said the company had no immediate plans to reduce the workforce at Hobart and that the facility would continue to be maintained. “Nyrstar Australia plays an important role in maximising the value of Australian metals and minerals,” Mr Milne said. “We remain optimistic about the future and have the flexibility to lift production levels when operating conditions improve.” The reduction in production will be implemented in a staged approach, with cuts at the Hobart smelter to begin in April and the duration of the decrease dependent upon future market and operating conditions.",

         "Proteomics International Laboratories (ASX: PIQ) has officially launched its unique PromarkerD predictive test for diabetic kidney disease in Australia. PromarkerD is a clinically validated blood test that helps predict the risk of developing chronic diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in type 2 diabetes patients up to four years before clinical symptoms appear. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease globally and the burden is particularly acute in Australia, where more than 1.3 million people are living with the condition. Importance of early diagnosis Managing director Dr Richard Lipscombe said the ability to obtain an early intervention window would enable better patient management while reducing the risk of severe kidney complications, including renal failure and the need for dialysis or transplant. “We are excited to officially launch PromarkerD in Australia, particularly on World Kidney Day, which underscores the importance of early diagnosis and prevention,” Dr Lipscombe said. “DKD is a major public health challenge and PromarkerD offers a highly innovative, accurate and accessible way to identify those most at risk.” “By enabling proactive management, we aim to reduce the personal and financial costs associated with this life-threatening condition.” Key stakeholder discussions The launch supports Proteomics International’s plans to achieve the widespread adoption of PromarkerD across Australia. The company is currently engaging with key stakeholders across local primary care networks, diabetes clinics and professional bodies. It aims to collaborate with health insurers, patient advocacy groups and government bodies to explore potential reimbursement pathways. The test will initially be available through a direct-to-consumer go-to-market route as a prelude to out-licensing to major industry players in the diagnostics sector. Landmark study published Proteomics reported earlier this week that the results from a landmark study into the benefits of PromarkerD had been published in a significant medical journal. The study confirmed that PromarkerD can significantly outperform the current standard-of-care tests in predicting future kidney function decline in type 2 diabetics. The results were published in the peer-reviewed journal Diagnostics in a paper titled “PromarkerD Versus Standard of Care Biochemical Measures for Assessing Future Renal Function Decline in Type 2 Diabetes”. “This peer-reviewed comparison against the standard of care is critical in proving the power of PromarkerD to the medical community,” Dr Lipscombe said. “We want to provide healthcare professionals with the best tools available to combat this debilitating disease.”",

         "GreenTech Metals (ASX: GRE) has confirmed down-plunge continuation of mineralisation in Stage 2 drilling at its Whundo copper project in Western Australia. The results have confirmed that both the Shelby and Austin shoots in the West Pilbara project maintain copper and zinc thickness. The current program, which commenced in December before being slowed down due to cyclonic weather in the region, is investigating down-dip conductor plates. Potential extensions GreenTech believes the results from the Stage 2 program represent potential extensions to the plunging mineralised shoots at Whundo’s Shelby, Austin, Yannery and Ayshia targets. The company has dispatched the samples from the program to a laboratory in Perth for detailed analysis. The existing Whundo/Ayshia mineral resource stands at 6.19 million tonnes at 1.12% copper and 1.04% zinc. Necessary adjustments Executive director Tom Reddicliffe said the adverse weather conditions necessitated adjustments to allow the company’s planned deep drill hole at Shelby to remain on target. “These visual results confirm that the two mineralised shoots are continuing down plunge,” Mr Reddicliffe said. “We will continue to explore the deeper reaches of [these] volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits, which represent great potential to significantly expand the project resources based on the size of their associated geophysical signatures and the results of drilling.” Assays being assessed GreenTech is currently awaiting the lab assessment of the early samples, with the results and planned down-hole electromagnetic surveys expected to help identify targets at Shelby and Austin for further drilling. The second stage of the drill program will continue to test under-explored mineralised prospects at Austin, Shelby, Yannery and Ayshia. GreenTech will review its priorities when the new drill sample assay and survey results are available, with any drilling at Shelby and Austin to be included as part of the Stage 2 program.",

         "Boss Energy (ASX: BOE) has agreed to acquire an additional 9% interest in Laramide Resources (ASX: LAM) , increasing its holding in the Queensland uranium developer to approximately 18.4% on an undiluted basis. Boss will acquire the additional shares for a total consideration of approximately $15.5 million. This will comprise approximately $3.9m in cash and approximately $11.7m via the issue of approximately 5.2 million new fully paid ordinary shares in Boss. Westmoreland uranium project Laramide’s flagship asset is the Westmoreland uranium project in Queensland and it also owns the Churchrock-Crownpoint uranium project in New Mexico. Exploration at Westmoreland has so far identified an Indicated resource of 27.8 million tonnes at an average grade of 770 parts per million for 48.1m contained pounds of U₃O₈. This includes an Inferred resource of approximately 11.8Mt at an average grade of 680ppm for 17.7m contained pounds of U₃O₈. No current takeover plans Boss managing director Duncan Craib said the company has no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover offer for Laramide. “This investment represents an attractive opportunity to secure exposure to the significant exploration and development upside at Westmoreland for a relatively small cost,” Mr Craib said. “Boss remains focused on delivering a successful ramp-up at our flagship Honeymoon uranium project in South Australia, which achieved commercial production in January 2025 and remains on track to meet FY25 production guidance of 850,000lb U₃O₈.” Queensland moratorium Boss believes the current moratorium on uranium mining in Queensland will eventually be reversed. “If the moratorium is overturned, Boss can apply its knowledge, experience and financial strength to the Westmoreland project,” Mr Craib added. “This would be of significant benefit to the people of Queensland and all stakeholders.” Alligator River deal Boss added a Northern Territory asset to its portfolio earlier this week, when it entered into an agreement to earn up to a 90% interest in the Liverpool project in the highly prospective Alligator River uranium field. Boss can earn an initial 49% interest in the project by spending $3m within three years and a further 31% interest (total 80%) by investing an additional $5m within four years after that. It will assume operational control over the project during the earn-in stage, where it has a minimum commitment of $1.5m in exploration expenditure before it can withdraw from the project.",

         "RareX (ASX: REE) has shown its confidence in the Mt Mansbridge xenotime heavy rare earths project by adding further exploration ground to the Western Australian asset. The WA Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety has notified RareX that it has granted tenements E80/5942 and E80/5973 within the project area. Xenotime is a rare-earth phosphate mineral that is a rich source of yttrium—a proxy element for the heavy rare earths used in many high-tech industries, including wind turbines, hybrid cars and electronic components. Browns Range similarities The push to expand Mt Mansbridge follows a recent assessment of the project that identified similarities to Northern Minerals’ (ASX: NTU) nearby Browns Range heavy rare earths project. Mt Mansbridge is located just 40 kilometres from Browns Range, considered one of the most significant heavy rare earth districts in the world with seven xenotime deposits hosting 11.7 million tonnes at 0.77% total rare earth oxide. RareX chief executive officer James Durrant noted that the geology at the Mt Mansbridge and Browns Range projects is closely aligned, with Mt Mansbridge featuring the same unconformity contact that hosts the high-grade Browns Range deposits. Xenotime mineralisation Outcropping xenotime mineralisation has been identified with historical pit samples at Mt Mansbridge and RareX sees significant exploration upside at the project including a 2km-long untested heavy rare earths soil anomaly. The company has scheduled heritage clearances for high priority areas within the project. It has also pegged a fourth, 40-block tenement (E80/6118) at Mt Mansbridge that is expected to be granted later this year. Substantial exploration package “The land package at our Mt Mansbridge heavy rare earths project is now substantial and ready for exploration,” Mr Durrant said. “We know there’s xenotime mineralisation on the project, we know the region and the native title holders well and we know the strategic nature of heavy rare earths to Australia.” “This project aligns with our focus on rare earths and niobium, supporting the global electrification megatrend—we look forward to progressing exploration activities and unlocking the full potential of this promising project.”",

         "Digital commerce software provider Ovanti (ASX: OVT) has signed a licensing agreement with BNPLPay Protocol to support future debt funding. BNPLPay Protocol is a blockchain-based lending platform tailored for the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) sector, with its decentralised finance network connecting stablecoin investors with BNPL providers. Under the licensing agreement, Ovanti will have access to BNPLPay’s lending platform on a preferential basis for 20 years. Strategic solution Ovanti executive chair and interim chief executive officer Daler Fayziev said the agreement is a strategic solution to the company’s long-standing debt-funding challenges. “Traditional banks and non-crypto lenders have historically offered financing on less favourable terms—often at high interest rates and with onerous requirements like first-loss,” Mr Fayziev said. “By contrast, BNPLPay Protocol provides us with a much more affordable capital source and does so without the need for any first-loss contribution from our side.” ” We view this partnership as a significant milestone for Ovanti–it not only secures low-cost funding for our BNPL operations but also lets us share in the success of the BNPLPay Protocol through a revenue stream.” BNPLPay ecosystem Ovanti will also play a key role in the BNPLPay ecosystem and benefit from a 50% share of the protocol’s revenues for 20 years pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement. “This long-term agreement positions Ovanti as both a featured user and a partner of BNPLPay Protocol, forging a deep alignment between the two companies,” Mr Fayziev said. Under BNPLPay’s decentralised lending model, Ovanti is able to draw on a pool of stablecoin-backed lenders at interest rates several percentage points lower than those charged by banks or other non-crypto financiers. No first-loss capital is required from Ovanti to utilise the BNPLPay Protocol’s funding. Financial consideration The financial consideration for the licensing agreement is $2,393,383. OVT is backing the acquisition with a placement to raise approximately $1.5 million. The placement will involve the issue of 235,000,000 shares at $0.00655 each to sophisticated investors, with a further 135,000,000 shares issued at the same price to BNPLPay Protocol.",

         "Barton Gold (ASX: BGD) (OTCQB: BGDFF) has achieved an impressive net profit after tax of $3.1 million for the December 2024 half-year on $8.5m in revenue. The main contributors were the company’s December 2024 gold sale that realised $5m and a $2.38m research and development tax refund. This is particularly notable given Barton fully expenses its exploration works, rather than capitalising them to its balance sheet. Strong gold tailwind “During the past three years, we have quickly and efficiently built a large-scale development platform and the gold market is offering a strong tailwind,” managing director Alexander Scanlon said. “Before 30 June, we will publish an Optimised Scoping Study for Tunkillia, [in which] we anticipate material efficiency gains.” “In parallel, we will deliver our plan to restart the Central Gawler Mill, with the aim of confirming a low-capex start to operations from 2026 and a low-risk, lower-dilution pathway to our 150,000 ounces per annum gold production target.” Dual successes Barton used the half-year to expand the mineral resource estimates at both its Tunkillia and Tarcoola projects. It achieved this through major exploration programs, the validation of new regional geological models, the application of novel mineral identification tools and methodologies and the drilling of new discoveries. Highlights included the addition of 20,000oz of gold to the Perseverance open-pit floor and a new high-grade gold-silver discovery at the Tolmer prospect at Tarcoola. Tunkillia ISS The company completed an Initial Scoping Study (ISS) at Tunkillia in July for a 5-million-tonne-per-annum bulk open-pit operation. The study focused on an initial 6.4-year life-of-mine with average production of around 130,000ozpa gold and approximately 311,000ozpa silver. Barton has identified an opportunity to develop Tunkillia at an all-in sustaining cost of approximately $1,917/oz of payable gold (net of silver credits), ranking it favourably among current Australian gold operations reporting this metric. With $9.2m in cash as at 13 January 2025, Barton is well capitalised to continue its aggressive exploration and development activities.",

         "New figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) have highlighted a major turnaround in onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration in the country. The latest ABS petroleum exploration expenditure figures show a seasonally-adjusted rise of 20.6% to $390.1 million and a 2.7% trend rise to $358.3m. Onshore exploration achieved a seasonally-adjusted rise of 26.2% to $238.2m and a trend rise of 0.3% to $217m. New programs Expenditure on offshore oil and gas exploration rose by 12.6% to $151.8m seasonally adjusted, with a trend rise of 6.3% to $140.9m. Significant new gas drilling programs off the Western Australian, South Australian, and Victorian coasts were major contributors. Australia’s offshore exploration level had been particularly hard hit in recent years, with the federal government deciding it wasn’t viable to undertake its annual acreage release. Meanwhile, onshore drilling has rebounded on the back of gas supply concerns and positive moves from the Queensland and Northern Territory governments. NT drilling surge ABS data show petroleum exploration expenditure in the NT reached $200m in the December 2024 quarter, the territory’s second-highest quarterly result on record. Petroleum exploration expenditure for the full calendar year totalled $369.7m, a 469% increase on the 2023 figure of $78.8m. New NT Minister for Mining and Energy, Gerard Maley, says the figures highlight growing investor confidence in the territory’s world-class gas basins. Onshore gas hunt “These results confirm that investors see the NT as a powerhouse for resource development, with our onshore gas basins leading the way in creating jobs and driving economic growth,” Mr Maley said. “Importantly, this investment translates into real benefits for Territorians, with more jobs and more opportunities for local businesses supporting the sector.” A significant proportion of the NT expenditure is likely to have been in the Beetaloo Sub-basin and Amadeus Basin. Second-highest total In total, petroleum and mineral exploration expenditure in the NT for 2024 reached $545.7m—the second-highest combined annual exploration investment ever recorded, behind the 2014 peak. Total expenditure for the calendar year reached $176m—a 23% decline from 2023, but still the fourth-highest annual expenditure on record. Mr Maley said the transition to a new environmental licensing regime also impacted activity but, with regulatory changes now in place, he expects the sector to stabilise in 2025. “The NT government is backing our resources sector because it is the backbone of our economy and a key driver of economic recovery,” he said. “We remain focused on ensuring the NT remains a leading jurisdiction for exploration, investment and job creation.”",

         "Magnum Mining and Exploration (ASX: MGU) has signed an agreement with Swedish company Wickers Group for the joint development of a novel combination of technologies to produce pulp, bio-chemicals and “green” pig iron. The two-year agreement will see the companies collaborate on projects that combine a pulp and paper plant with the HIsmelt direct smelting process to produce pulp, lumber, bio-chemicals and pig iron in Europe and North America. They will use a co-product known as biochar in the HIsmelt plant to smelt iron ore and produce green pig iron, with further synergies achieved through the transfer of excess steam from the smelting process to provide heat for the plant. Combination technologies Magnum non-executive director Neil Goodman welcomed the agreement. “Wickers has developed a combination of existing technologies to produce pulp and lumber from pulp timber and forestry waste and co-produce biochar, green fertiliser, bio-alcohol, proteins and biogenic carbon dioxide,” he said. “The biochar will be a great reductant for a HIsmelt furnace that will smelt iron ore and steel plant waste to produce green pig iron and, as an extra bonus, the HIsmelt plant will produce excess steam from waste gas, which can be fed back to the pulp plant to provide heat for the processes.” Developing synergies Wickers chief executive officer Mikael Carlsson said the company looked forward to working with Magnum. “We look forward to developing synergies between our pulp and paper technologies and HIsmelt technology,” he said. “We call this combination the ‘BioCombine’ and our teams have started working together to attract investors and industry partners and investigate potential sites for a world-first BioCombine plant.” Pig iron project Magnum form a joint venture (JV) with Indian private company 2×1.Digital Private in August for the trading, production and supply of biochar, iron ore and green pig iron in Malaysia. Magnum expects the JV and proposed integrated business in Malaysia to complement its existing global activities, including the proposed establishment of a green pig iron project in Saudi Arabia. That project will involve the construction of a HIsmelt plant to be fed by steel mill waste augmented by magnetite from Magnum’s proposed Buena Vista mine in the US. Mr Goodman said negotiations with a Saudi steelmaking company were progressing well.",

         "PhosCo (ASX: PHO) has received a key approval, commenced a $5 million capital raising and finalised global financing support to move its Gasaat phosphate project in Tunisia towards commercialisation. The company’s receipt of an exploration permit enables it to immediately commence its planned major resource drilling program at Gasaat. It follows the company signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year with the government of Tunisia and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in a first-of-its-kind deal for Tunisia. Booming market The new drilling will test the upside identified at Gasaat, which contains a significant JORC resource of 146.4 million tonnes at 20.6% phosphorus pentoxide. PhosCo is targeting the valuable global fertiliser market, which analysts estimate will grow to more than $380 billion by 2030. Increasing demand for food, the need to improve soil fertility and the use of more sophisticated fertilisers is set to drive this growth. Entitlement offer PhosCo has launched a fully underwritten $5 million entitlement offer to help fund the drilling and other future developments. The company’s directors and major shareholder Lion Selection (ASX: LSX) have committed to priority sub-underwriting totalling $3.25m. Lion Selection and PhosCo managing director Taz Aldaoud have also agreed to advance a $1.5m loan to fast-track work at Gasaat. EBRD potential investment In another major breakthrough, PhosCo has signed a mandate letter with the EBRD for a potential investment of approximately $8m (US$5m), which it will utilise to support a bankable feasibility study for Gasaat. “Securing formal ownership of the Gasaat phosphate project is a pivotal event in PhosCo’s journey to becoming a global fertiliser producer,” Mr Aldaoud said. “Expanding the Gasaat inventory underpins potential increases in the forecast production rate and free cash flow generation.” ‘Clear pathway’ “With the project now officially granted, Gasaat has a clear pathway to production and cash flow, ensuring it is very well positioned to capitalise on this opportunity,” Mr Aldaoud added. PhosCo’s new field work program will focus on areas of upside identified in the 2022 scoping study, which nearly doubled the project tenement size. Recognised phosphate expert Sam Lancuba, who has more than 45 years’ experience in the sector, has agreed to join the board as a non-executive director following completion of the entitlement offer.",

         "Panther Metals (ASX: PNT) has commenced a significant follow-up drill program to test for extensions of its recent high-grade hits at the Burtville East gold project in Western Australia. The campaign is following up on the company’s 2024 drilling program that returned wide, high-grade gold intercepts with multiple 1m bonanza-grade peaks, such as 127 grams per tonne gold. The company staged a successful placement earlier this month that raised $685,000 to support the program. Range of tests The 2,000-metre drill program will also test a range of activities with a view to monetising the high-grade gold. “Our analysis of last quarter’s drill campaign […] underscored the project’s potential and the need for additional funding to further explore for any potential gold extensions at Burtville East and capitalise on the current strong gold price,” chief executive officer Daniel Tuffin said. “The company will also utilise this program to advance the project via probing historic workings for future bulk sampling activities, conducting metallurgical and mineralogical studies to support mining reviews and assessing the existing high-grade stockpiles for potential monetisation.” “With drilling now underway, we look forward to providing further updates as results come to hand.” Goldfields location Burtville East is located on the north-western edge of the company’s Laverton gold project in Western Australia’s famous goldfields region. The project area contains historic underground workings, along with existing mineralised stockpiles that are ready for treatment. Historical grab samples from stockpiles returned grades of up to 38.45g/t gold, while grabs taken by the company in 2022 returned a peak grade of 21.7g/t gold. The company’s 2022 maiden drilling campaign discovered multiple gold-rich quartz lodes adjacent to the main Burtville East lode from just six reverse circulation holes over a total of 577m and two diamond holes over a total of 147m.",
